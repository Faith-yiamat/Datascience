# Data Science
 The pull request contains stacks and tuples. 
## Stacks
 It is a linear data structure that holds a linear, ordered sequence of elements. I learned how to add items, remove items, and create a stack itself. A stack follows a LIFO principle which states that the last insert is the first to be removed.
## Tuples
 It is a collection of objects separated by a comma. They are immutable so one cannot be able to modified once it is created. I have create a tuple, add items to a tuple by turning it into a list therefore adding items and removing them and also accessing items using indexing.
